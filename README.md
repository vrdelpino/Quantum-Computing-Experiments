# Quantum Computing Experiments

Quantum Computing Experiments is a test project using different Quantum simulators and libraries like Q# and IBM QExperience.

### Q# Programming Language ([Q# Experiments])

What is [Q# Programming Language]? 

Q# (Q-sharp) is a domain-specific programming language used for expressing quantum algorithms. It is to be used for writing subroutine that execute on an adjunct quantum processor, under the control of a classical host program and computer. Until quantum processors are widely available, Q# subroutines execute on a simulator.

Where find it?

I downloaded the Quantum Development Kit from Microsoft Quantum initiative web ([Quantum Development Kit])
In order to develop a full program we'll need the following components:
  - [Quantum Development Kit]
  - [.NET Core SDK]
  - [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio]
  - [Visual Studio Code]

 
### Setup of the components

First of all we'll need to download and install the [.NET Core SDK]
Once it is installed, we'll need to run the following command to download the project templates

  ```
  dotnet new -i Microsoft.Quantum.ProjectTemplates
  ```

Next step is to download Visual Studio Code for MAC, this tool is opcional but quite handy when developing with Q#.
After installing Visual Studio Code, final step is to install the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio] extension.

#### Validate the environment

After installing the needed components, we must validate that everything in the environment works fine. In order to validate our environment, we'll need to:

  - Download the test program from Microsoft's Github

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum.git
  ```

  - Change directory to the target program

  ```
  cd Quantum/Samples/src/Teleportation/
  ```

  - Execute the program

  ```
  dotnet run
  ```

If the environment has been correctly setup, we should get the following output:

  ```
        Round 0:        Sent True,      got True.
        Teleportation successful!!
        Round 1:        Sent False,     got False.
        Teleportation successful!!
        ...
        Round 6:        Sent True,      got True.
        Teleportation successful!!
        Round 7:        Sent False,     got False.
        Teleportation successful!!
  ```




#### Running our first Q# program 

For the first Quantum Program I'm going to run a simulation of [Bell Experiment]. 
One of the main properties in Quantum Computing is [Quantum Entanglement] and [Quantum Superposition]. 

Qunatum Entanglement is in a nutshell the property in which two quantum particles are connected no matter their location. This would break some physical laws as it would mean information can be transported faster than speed light (this would happen if each particle would be located in a different corner of the universe). In order to test this property (called by Einstein "spooky action at distance") Bell created an experiment to confirm this "spooky action". This experiment will be the first program I will try in Quantum Computing

When programming in Q# there are two main files needed:

  - Driver. Driver is the responsible to execute the quantum code for the program.
  - Quantum Code. In this file is stored the quantum code itse.f

For this program, there are two files:
  - Driver.cs
  ```

    using System;

    using Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Core;
    using Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Simulators;

    namespace Bell
    {
        class Driver
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                using (var qsim = new QuantumSimulator())
                {
                    // Try initial values
                    Result[] initials = new Result[] { Result.Zero, Result.One };
                    foreach (Result initial in initials)
                    {
                        var res = BellTest.Run(qsim, 1000, initial).Result;
                        var (numZeros, numOnes, agree) = res;
                        System.Console.WriteLine(
                            $"Init:{initial,-4} 0s={numZeros,-4} 1s={numOnes,-4} agree={agree,-4}");
                    }
                }

                System.Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue...");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
        }
    }

  ```

  - Bell.qs

  ```
    namespace Bell
    {
        open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
        open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

        operation Set (desired: Result, q1: Qubit) : Unit
        {
            let current = M(q1);
            if (desired != current)
            {
                X(q1);
            }
        }
        
        operation BellTest (count : Int, initial: Result) : (Int, Int, Int)
        {
            mutable numOnes = 0;
            mutable agree = 0;
            using (qubits = Qubit[2])
            {
                for (test in 1..count)
                {
                    Set (initial, qubits[0]);
                    Set (Zero, qubits[1]);

                    H(qubits[0]);
                    CNOT(qubits[0], qubits[1]);
                    let res = M (qubits[0]);

                    if (M (qubits[1]) == res) 
                    {
                        set agree = agree + 1;
                    }

                    // Count the number of ones we saw:
                    if (res == One)
                    {
                        set numOnes = numOnes + 1;
                    }
                }

                Set(Zero, qubits[0]);
                Set(Zero, qubits[1]);
            }

            // Return number of times we saw a |0> and number of times we saw a |1>
            return (count-numOnes, numOnes, agree);
        }

    }

  ```
