# Quantum Teleportation Sample #

This sample demonstrates the use of the Quantum Development Kit for quantum teleportation, a sort of "hello, world" for quantum programming.

## Running the Sample ##

Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set *Samples / 0. Introduction / TeleportationSample* as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the example.

## Manifest ##

- [TeleportationSample.qs](./TeleportationSample.qs): Q# code defining how to teleport qubit states.
- [Program.cs](./Program.cs): C# code to call the operations defined in Q#.
- [TeleportationSample.csproj](./TeleportationSample.csproj): Main C# project for the example.
